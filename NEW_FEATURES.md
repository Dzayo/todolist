# New Features Added

## 1. Editable Task Titles ‚úèÔ∏è

Tasks now have editable titles with two ways to edit:
- **Double-click** on any task title to enter edit mode
- Click the **Edit button** (pencil icon) that appears on hover

When editing:
- Press **Enter** to save changes
- Press **Escape** to cancel
- Click the **Save** (checkmark) button to save
- Click the **Cancel** (X) button to discard changes

## 2. Drag & Drop with Hierarchy Changes üîÑ

Tasks can now be rearranged using drag and drop:
- **Hover** over a task to see the grip handle (six dots)
- **Drag** the task by clicking and holding
- **Drop** onto another task to make it a child/subtask
- Tasks automatically update their parent-child relationships
- Visual indicators show where the task will be dropped

This allows you to:
- Reorganize task order
- Change task hierarchy (make a task a subtask of another)
- Move subtasks to become top-level tasks
- Nest tasks at any level

## 3. Task Descriptions with Modal üìù

Each task can now have a detailed description:
- Click the **FileText icon** (document icon) that appears on hover
- A modal dialog opens with a large text area
- Add or edit detailed notes about the task
- The icon turns **purple** when a task has a description
- The icon stays **gray** when no description exists

The description modal shows:
- Task title for context
- Large textarea for detailed notes
- Save and Cancel buttons
- Click outside the modal to close without saving

## Database Changes

Two new columns have been added to the `tasks` table:
- `description` (TEXT) - Stores the task description
- `sort_order` (INT) - For future task ordering implementation

### For Existing Databases

If you already have a database, run the migration:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < server/migrate-add-description.sql
```

Or manually in MySQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN description TEXT AFTER title,
ADD COLUMN sort_order INT DEFAULT 0 AFTER status;
```

### For New Databases

The updated `server/init-db.sql` already includes these columns.

## API Changes

The tasks API now supports:
- `description` field in POST and PUT requests
- `parentId` field in PUT requests (for drag & drop)
- `sortOrder` field (reserved for future use)

## User Interface Improvements

- **Drag Handle**: Grip icon appears on hover for dragging
- **Edit Button**: Pencil icon for entering edit mode
- **Description Button**: FileText icon that changes color based on whether description exists
- **Visual Feedback**: Border highlights during drag operations
- **Inline Editing**: Seamless title editing without page refresh
- **Modal Dialog**: Beautiful, centered modal for description editing

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with state management for drag/drop and editing modes
- **Backend**: Express.js API with MySQL database
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons (GripVertical, Edit2, FileText, Save, X)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive and modern UI
- **Drag Events**: Native HTML5 drag and drop API
